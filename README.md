### What I learned

By creating this webisite I learned two things: how to interact with big background images, and how to create a dropdown menu from scratch.

I have worked with images before (e.g. small picture of myself for my website); however, I have never worked with images that were as big as the images provided and I have never had to position images to match a specific design. I was able to get the images to match the design provided for the desktop version.

For this project I had to learn how to create a dropdown menu from scratch. This was not too troublesome except for trying to figure out how to close the menu if clicked outside of the dropdown menu element. I found that the solution to this was a little complex, so I compromised and instead had the dropdown close if you clicked the same menu toggle or any other dropdown menu toggle.

### Continued development

Here are a few things I will add in the future when I continue this challenge:

- Mobile Version
- Dropdown Menus that close from clicking anywhere on the screen
